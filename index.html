    <p>This page is being re-built from scratch and ditching the blog format.
      I've been wanting to go back to a more standard site structure for a while
      now so I figure I needed to really stop putting it off.</p>

    <p>Now that doesn't mean I'm not gonna maintain a blog, In fact the
      blog was just migrated to its own repo for the express purpose of me
      continuing it! You can find it at the link <a href="./DevBlog">Here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I would actually advise anyone with the misfortune of landing on this page
      in this state to follow the above link, as it has a good deal of things
      I've worked on easily accessible, at least until I finish building the
      site.
      <br>Thanks for understanding.

      so now you can view it at the following <a href="./FCC">link</a>
