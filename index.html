    <p>This page is being re-done from scratch and ditching the blog format.
      I've been wanting to go back to a more standard site structure for a while
      now so I figure I needed to really stop putting it off.</p>

    <p>Now that doesn't mean I'm not gonna maintain a blog, In fact the
      blog is was migrated to its own repo for the express purpose of me
      continuing it! You can find it at the link <a href="./DevBlog">Here</a>.
